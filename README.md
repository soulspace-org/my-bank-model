# My Bank Model

This project contains an example Overarch model of a banking organization
'MyBank'.
It is an extension of the banking example included in the [Overarch repository](https://github.com/soulspace-org/overarch)
to showcase features of Overarch and to show an example of an architecture model
project.

It should provide more elements then a simple 'hello world' example like the
overarch banking model.

It is not the goal of this model to provide you with a blueprint for your own
banking system landscape, as I'm not an enterprize architect for an actual bank.

## Prerequisites
To generate diagrams and documentation for this model, you need to have Java 11+ and Graphviz installed.
